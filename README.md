## Ask yourself the following questions:
- Is my resume easy to navigate and read?
- Does my resume focus on accomplishments and results (not mundane duties)
- Do I use data and metrics as evidence of my achievements?

## Make sure your resume looks good in a responsive format as well!
- How does it look on your phone in Portrait view, how about in Landscape?
- Add in at least *one* breakpoint to make your page mobile responsive
